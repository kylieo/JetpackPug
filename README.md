Click to make Jetpack Pug fly! Avoid the evil killer donuts.

JetPack Pug is a simple endless runner game demo similar to Flappy Bird. I made this for my second project in the General Assembly Web Development Immersive program. I wanted to add more features to my game but I only had one week for the assignment and I spent most of the week learning the Phaser framework and game development principles. I was happy that I managed to get the pug to fly as well as create a parallax background and collision collection. I'd like to work on the game more and create a pug version of Flappy Bird.
